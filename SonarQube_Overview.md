#   SonarQube Overview

##  Introduction
-   Its an Open-Source tool designed for continuous inspection of Code Quality.
-   It performs automatic reviews of code to ditect bugs, code smells & Security Vulnarabilities across various languages.
-   Its a key tool used for ensuring code quality & maintaining security standerds throughout the development process.
-   It has both Community(Free) & Enterprise version.

#### Note:
-   This analysis is done on source code without executing it.

##  Features
-   **Code Analysis:**
    -   It provides comprehensive code analyis to identify issues in the code.
    -   It highlets bugs, code smells & security vulnarabilities with detail insights & suggestions for improvements.

-   **Generate Test Report:**
    -   It provides detailed reports that provides metrics on various aspects of code quality.

-   **Code Coverage:**
    -   It can be integrated with various testing frameworks to measure code coverage.
    -   This feature helps ensure the code is well-tested & the tests cover critical parts of the applicatiion.

-   **Continuous Inspection**
-   **Code Quality Metrics**
-   **Extensive Rule Set**

##  Analyis Types
-   **Static Application Secutiry Testing(SAST):**
    -   It is to identify the Vulnarabilities in the source code.
    -   It analyses the code without executing it.

-   **Software Composition Analyis(SCA):**
    -   It is to identify potential security risks & license compliance issues associated with opensource-components & librarys used in ther code.

-   **Authentication & Authorization:**
    -   This feature is for managing authentication & autherization, ensuring access to the platform & its data is secure & properly controlled.

-   **Security Hotspots:**
    -   It highlets security-sensitive peace of code that requires manual review by the developer.

##  Supported Languages for Analyis
